            Layne Staley, the iconic vocalist of Alice In Chains, dedicated his life to
            inspiring and empowering others through his music. A true visionary and
            innovator, he used his platform to bring attention to social and
            environmental issues, and to fight against the stigma surrounding mental
            health. Rest in peace, Layne.
