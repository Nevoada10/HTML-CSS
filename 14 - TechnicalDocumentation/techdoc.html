                HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create and structure content on the web. 
                It provides the basic structure of web pages, which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. 
                CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

                To start with HTML and CSS, you need a simple text editor and a web browser. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, 
                Sublime Text, or Atom. These editors provide helpful features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion.
            </p>

                Modern web browsers come with built-in developer tools that allow you to inspect and debug your HTML and CSS code. 
                These tools are essential for web development and can be accessed by right-clicking and selecting 'Inspect' or pressing F12.

                HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages. They are represented by tags, which label pieces of content such as 
                "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on. Most elements have an opening and closing tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS can be applied to HTML elements in three ways: inline (using the style attribute), internal (using the style tag in the HTML file), 
                or external (linking to a separate CSS file). External CSS is the most maintainable approach for larger projects.

                <li>HTML elements must be properly nested, with the most specific element inside the more general one</li>
                <li>CSS selectors determine which elements the styles will be applied to</li>
                <li>Classes can be reused across multiple elements while IDs must be unique</li>
                <li>The CSS Box Model includes content, padding, border, and margin properties</li>
                <li>Responsive design ensures your website looks good on all device sizes</li>

            <section class="main-section" id="Troubleshooting">

            <p>
                Common HTML issues include incorrect tag nesting, missing closing tags, and improper use of attributes. Using a code validator 
                like the W3C Markup Validation Service can help identify and fix these problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS troubleshooting often involves dealing with specificity issues, cascading conflicts, and browser compatibility. Browser 
                developer tools are invaluable for inspecting styles and identifying which CSS rules are being applied or overridden.

            <p>
                One common question is about the difference between HTML5 semantic elements like header, nav, main, and article versus 
                using generic div elements. Semantic elements provide better structure and accessibility for your web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another frequent question concerns CSS positioning and layout techniques. While traditional methods like float and position 
                were common, modern approaches like Flexbox and Grid provide more powerful and flexible ways to create responsive layouts.
